#### Hi! This is Pradipan from Hyderabad, India. My Full Name is Pradipan Pal and an Indian Citizen (by birth). I have a Masters and Bachelors Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Kolkata, India.
#### My areas of expertise are Cryptography and Machine Learning. My current Research Focus is on the Security and Privacy Issues in Deep Learing Systems, more from an Implementation Perspective. I love to explore the Maths behind Crypto and ML. ðŸ”­
#### I am always excited to learn more about Security/Crypto and ML/DL and their interplay. I follow the Tech Space in these areas as my passion.
#### I strongly believe Crypto Primitives can help us solve the Privacy Problem much prevalent in almost all AI models we use today. Its our Privacy and we need to Protect it.
